# Coordinates Display
Coordinates Display is a simple mod for displaying your coordinates as an HUD in-game. It shows your x, y, and z positions, your chunk location, the direction you're looking in, and the biome you're in on an HUD in game.

The HUD is customizable as well. Firstly, you could toggle the hud by pressing a keybind.

That's not all! Use the Mod Menu integration to open the Configuration GUI. Now you can change all the options!

In this image, I have changed the keys color to "dark_aqua" and the values color to "aqua". There are many different color combinations you could choose from. List of colors [here](https://www.digminecraft.com/lists/color_list_pc.php).

By pressing "C", you can open the Coordinates GUI. Here you can copy your coordinates or send them in chat!

Finally, the mod will show your death position on the death screen when you die. This can be turned off, just like all of the other aspects of the HUD.

You can also decide whether the mod should post your death location in the chat. Only you will be able to see it.
