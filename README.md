# Coordinates Display

Coordinates Display is a Client-side Fabric Mod that adds an HUD to your game. This HUD shows your position, your chunk position, the direction you are looking in, and the name of the biome you are in.

# Dependencies

## Fabric

[![Requires Fabric API](https://i.imgur.com/Ol1Tcf8.png)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)

I also recommend you install [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu/) for configuration purposes. It is required to open the Configuration GUI.

## Forge

This mod requires [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) for configuration.

# Customizing

There are many different ways you could make your HUD look. For starters, you can use the key binds to turn on/off the HUD. Here are some examples:

In this image, I have changed the "Keys" options in the color settings to aqua. There are [16 different colors](https://www.digminecraft.com/lists/color_list_pc.php) that you could choose from.

In this image, I have disabled the biome and the chunk location in the rendering settings.

# Death Position

Coordinates Display will tell you your location when you die. This can be really helpful when you die and need to get your inventory back. This can be easily turned off in the configuration GUI. Where will this be displayed?

### The Death Screen

The location of your death can be displayed on the death screen. To turn this off, simply toggle the "Display on death screen" option in the Death Position category on the Config GUI.

### In Chat

The location of your death can also be sent as a chat message. Only you will be able to see it. To turn this off, simple toggle the "Send in chat" option in the Death Position category on the Config GUI.
