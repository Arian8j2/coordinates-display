# Coordinates Display
Coordinates Display mod is a simple mod for displaying your coordinates as an HUD in-game. It shows you your x, y, and z positions, your chunk x and y, the direction you're looking in, and the biome you're in.

The HUD is is customizable as well. There are many different ways you could make your HUD look. Simply use one of the key binds to customize it!

In this image, I have turned off the biome and the direction.

You cannot change all of the options with the key binds however. Use the "Open Configuration File" key bind to locate the config file. Now you can change every option!

In this image, I have changed definitionColor to "dark_aqua" and dataColor to "aqua". There are many different color combinations you could choose from. List of colors [here](https://www.digminecraft.com/lists/color_list_pc.php).
