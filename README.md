# Coordinates Display
Coordinates Display is a simple mod for displaying your coordinates as an HUD in-game. It shows you your x, y, and z positions, your chunk x and y, the direction you're looking in, and the biome you're in.

The HUD is customizable as well. Firstly, you could toggle the hud by pressing a keybind.

That's not all! Use the Mod Menu integration to open the Configuration GUI. Now you can change all the options!

In this image, I have changed the keys color to "dark_aqua" and the values color to "aqua". There are many different color combinations you could choose from. List of colors [here](https://www.digminecraft.com/lists/color_list_pc.php).

By pressing "C", you can open the Coordinates GUI. Here you can copy your coordinates or send them in chat!
